If you're seeking to bridge the gap between software development and ML deployment, I could be the person you're looking for.","about":"Hey! My name is Andre. I'm a third year undergraduate studying at the National University of Singapore.\n      I like reading about research on AI and advancements in ML, and spend a fair portion of my time doing so. Explainable AI in particular has caught my attention in recent months. ML is also a field where I can put what i've learnt in brutal math courses (at least some of it.. *_*) to use. I believe there's plenty of research done in the ML landscape, yet few are being adopted and deployed to use. Perhaps it is due to a general lack of expertise, or inherent doubts. Regardless, it is unfortunate.\n      Deep learning, Natural Language Processing, AI decision making - are some sub-fields that excite me. But i've some exposure in the basics of other fields - Databases, Networks, Operating Systems, Parallel & Distributed systems to name a few. I hope to hone my knowledge in my remaining semesters and become a proficient ML engineer able to bridge the gap between software development and ML deployment.\n      Beyond academia, I am an avid climber and belong to the school's Mountaineering club. Together with a couple of wonderful, fun-loving, and free-spirited friends, we scaled a mountain in the Himalayas and it was, well, simply fantastic.","author":"","email":"andre_lin@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/4ndrelim","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-linhk/"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/blog/the-first-commit/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"Invalid date","title":"The First Commit","description":"Why a portfolio?"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
