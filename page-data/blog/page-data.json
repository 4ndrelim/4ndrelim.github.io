My name is Andre. I'm a third year undergraduate studying Mathematics & Computer Science at the National University of Singapore.\n      I like reading about research on AI and advancements in ML, and spend a fair portion of my time doing so. ML is a field where I can put what i've learnt in brutal math courses (𝘢𝘵 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘵 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘪𝘵.. *_*) to use. I believe there's plenty of research done in the ML landscape, yet few are being adopted and deployed to use. Perhaps it is due to a general lack of expertise, or inherent doubts. Regardless, it is unfortunate.\n      Deep learning, Natural Language Processing, AI decision making - are some sub-fields that excite me. But i've some exposure in the basics of other fields - Databases, Networks, Operating Systems, Parallel & Distributed systems to name a few. I hope to hone my knowledge in my remaining semesters and become a proficient ML engineer able to bridge the gap between software development and ML deployment.\n      Beyond academia, I am an avid climber and belong to the school's Mountaineering club. Together with a couple of 𝘸𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘶𝘭, 𝘧𝘶𝘯-𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘰𝘰 friends, we scaled a mountain in the Himalayas and it was, well, simply fantastic.","author":"","email":"andre_lin@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/4ndrelim","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-linhk/"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"excerpt":"A New Semester Again, it’s 3am into the night.
