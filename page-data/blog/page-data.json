My name is Andre. I'm a third year undergraduate studying Mathematics & Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n      I like reading about research advancements in Machine Learning. ML is an exciting field at the intersection of mathematical theory (brutal math courses finally paying off.. *_*) and software engineering - where magic comes to life and 𝘉𝘭𝘢𝘥𝘦 𝘙𝘶𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘳 teases at a possible future. There's no shortage of groundbreaking research in the ML landscape, and I aspire to be among those who bring these innovations into real-world applications.\n      ML is a broad and dynamic field with plenty to learn. While i've developed some foundation in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, to name a few, there remains much more to explore. I am now particularly interested in the intricacies of parallelism (and coding) in optimizing training code. My goal is to become a proficient ML engineer, capable of bridging the gap between software development and ML deployment.\n      Beyond academia, I am a casual climber (an occasional diver, and avid backpacker) and belong to the school's Mountaineering club. Together with a couple of 𝘸𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘶𝘭, 𝘧𝘶𝘯-𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘰𝘰 friends, we scaled a mountain in the Himalayas and it was, well, simply fantastic.","author":"","email":"andre_lin@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/4ndrelim","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-linhk/"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/blog/krabi/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 21, 2024","title":"Krabi Yet Again.
