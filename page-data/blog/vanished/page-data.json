A much-needed winter break is ahead, though it’s packed with activities. I’m returning to the army for a week, then off to Batu caves with a new bunch. But the highlight of the holidays is a month-long long adventure in the Nordic lands (mostly Norway). Prep’s going to be tight.</p>\n<h2>Growth Spurt</h2>\n<h3>2022: A Year of Expansion</h3>\n<p>2022 was a tough year, I ventured into new territories and hopped from one place to another. Some relationships faded, regrettable, but new ones were forged too. Though it wasn’t until a few months had gone by and high up in the Himalayas for me to lament the absence of old flames.</p>\n<p>But the path of learning has been incredible. I’ve gained so much knowledge and skills, and it feels like i’m accelerating and gaining more momentum with each passing day.</p>\n<h3>2023: Intense and Defining but a Ridiculous Timetable</h3>\n<p>In many ways, 2023 was even tougher, but brought alongside more defining moments.</p>\n<p>Frequent, intense trainings for my first ever mountaineering expedition in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Software engineer by day and tragic mugger by night.</p>\n<p>Balancing academic load with teaching duties.</p>\n<p>Getting experience with research projects.</p>\n<p>Diving into higher-level exciting ML modules - a sobering yet reassuring realization that I’m just skimming the surface of an immense field.</p>\n<p>And then, the long nights of LeetCode and job preparation. Man, it felt like I absorbed more in the past 2-3 years of exponential progress than in the previous 20 years, a trajectory i’m eager to continue (at least, still keen on plunging head-first into treacherous waters).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/aae4b8dfd96b33c8afc87a0d9a434e2c/eea4a/training.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"training\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/aae4b8dfd96b33c8afc87a0d9a434e2c/1c72d/training.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/aae4b8dfd96b33c8afc87a0d9a434e2c/a80bd/training.jpg 148w,\n/static/aae4b8dfd96b33c8afc87a0d9a434e2c/1c91a/training.jpg 295w,\n/static/aae4b8dfd96b33c8afc87a0d9a434e2c/1c72d/training.jpg 590w,\n/static/aae4b8dfd96b33c8afc87a0d9a434e2c/a8a14/training.jpg 885w,\n/static/aae4b8dfd96b33c8afc87a0d9a434e2c/fbd2c/training.jpg 1180w,\n/static/aae4b8dfd96b33c8afc87a0d9a434e2c/eea4a/training.jpg 1280w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Mixed Emotions in the Pursuit</h2>\n<p><em>Most days were fun but some nights were tougher than others</em>.</p>\n<h3>The Grind</h3>\n<p>The later half of the year saw me doubling down on my efforts in the internship hunt. I would retreat to my comfy quarters, play some lo-fi or city pop and grind leetcode questions. There is something strangely soothing with tackling these problem-solving questions. I suppose its because they are closed questions, an unequivocal answer exists, and this brought a peculiar comfort amidst the chaos.</p>\n<p>Competition has become so much more intense. It isn’t just sufficient to be all-round technically competent, now there’s a whole emphasis on behavioural fit, diversity inclusion imbued into the many rounds of interview. Securing a spot among hundreds of applicants for just a few measly positions was daunting. <br/>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\n<i>How worrying.</i>\n</span></p>\n<p>It is not to say that my efforts didn’t yield any results. For one, my resume has caught more attention and I made it to several final rounds. Some of which are Quant firms that most CS majors would dream of. I figured I would eventually be filtered out (not quite yet ready to headbutt against our dear fellow IOI and IMO olympiad winners) but I wanted to see how far i’d get, and maybe scout a little for an all-out attempt in the near future.</p>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised to learn I made it to the last rounds, and with it, inevitably built up hope, and naturally, eventual disappointment. Still, this means i’d stand a fairly good chance at decent firms a tier down, right? <br/>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\n<i>That’s assuring.</i>\n</span></p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4147022a5d1f59d9fd64cc2597c15995/6a068/dior.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.1081081081081%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"dior\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/4147022a5d1f59d9fd64cc2597c15995/1c72d/dior.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/4147022a5d1f59d9fd64cc2597c15995/a80bd/dior.jpg 148w,\n/static/4147022a5d1f59d9fd64cc2597c15995/1c91a/dior.jpg 295w,\n/static/4147022a5d1f59d9fd64cc2597c15995/1c72d/dior.jpg 590w,\n/static/4147022a5d1f59d9fd64cc2597c15995/a8a14/dior.jpg 885w,\n/static/4147022a5d1f59d9fd64cc2597c15995/6a068/dior.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <em>Dior sneaking up as I study</em>\n</div>\n<h3>Relentless</h3>\n<p>Turns out, I was wrong, dead-ass wrong. Dozens more applications and a couple more interviews got me pretty much nowhere. I thought I at least performed well for some, given I was able to answer most of the technical questions. But I guess I might have fallen short in other aspects. That and there was probably plenty of equally qualified candidates with possibly more to offer. So there I was, <strong>with plenty of small Ws but no one single concrete W</strong>. <br/>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\n<i>How frustrating.</i>\n</span></p>\n<p>I decided to expand my search globally. Since i’m facing troubles finding a local internship, might as well gun for overseas ones and take the opportunity to travel abroad. The thought excited me, travelling while working.</p>\n<p><em>Finally, spreading my wings eh, heh</em>.</p>\n<p>So I began blasting out applications indiscriminately to anywhere and everywhere. I knew obtaining a work visa might be problematic but securing overseas internship isn’t unheard of and so I figured, surely it would eventually work out right? Just focus on the technicals and the path will reveal itself. <br/>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\n<i>How naive.</i>\n</span></p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way, school started becoming a little trickier. I know I signed-up for this but damn, some days I would just walk into class, sit down and wonder: <br/>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\n<i>??? what the heck are those symbols. And why is he making it sound so trivial..</i>\n</span></p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, Ming Yang is an excellent TA by the way.

That said, I picked up more than the average student (will be finishing up the blog on LLMs!) and my grades for these modules were stellar. The others, well, they aren’t bad, but probably could’ve done better.</p>\n<p>My local internship hunt wasn’t going too well and it was nearing the end of the semester. Overseas hunt sent me on a wild goose chase. Remember the Visa issue mentioned? Well, yeah that kinda came back biting me in the ass. Turns out, securing a visa internship outside the states was more problematic that I had imagined. Process is convoluted and most firms (less the well-known ones) naturally wouldn’t know much about facilitating the visa process. TLDR, the ones that I had high hopes for, which coincidentally happened to be outside of the states, figured they can continue their lives fine without me. <br/>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\n<i>More frustration.</i>\n</span></p>\n<h3>Sometimes, the light at the end of a tunnel..</h3>\n<div align=\"center\"> is an oncoming train. </div>\n<br/>\n<p>Now, I am back at square one. It didn’t help, emotionally, seeing close friends secure offers. I’m sure they’ve put in the work; those offers are well‑deserved. <br/>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\nStill, can’t help but feel <i>Envy creeping in.</i>\n</span></p>\n<p>More concerning, I started having doubts. Perhaps i’m doing it all wrong. Maybe I could have better focused my efforts on certain aspects. Maybe it was the way I carried myself. Maybe I failed to explain my thoughts with sufficient clarity. Maybe I just wasn’t a good fit for the company. Maybe I could have choked less.</p>\n<p>Bunch of maybes, no idea where to start working on. But something has to change, and I will ponder more over the winter break.</p>\n<h3>Not All Was Bad</h3>\n<p>2023 was also a re-defining year. <strong>The seeds of change have been sowed</strong>. I travelled a lot more this year, some with friends, some alone. Two trips really stood out, during which I found myself becoming increasingly introspective. From plunging into the beautiful depths of the sea to scaling the majestic heights of the Himalayas, I’ve done a fair bit of living. For once, I truly felt that there is so much more to life than academia and work.</p>\n<p>I’ve also had the opportunity to speak with several established mountaineers. And it’s high-time to start pondering </br>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\nHow serious of a mountaineer I wish to become, <br/>\nHow high the peaks I would like to scale, <br/>\nHow treacherous the climbs I wish to endeavour, <br/>\nand I guess, <br/>\nHow selfish of a man I might become.\n</span></p>\n<h2>Old Habits Die Hard</h2>\n<p>So I started the semester all ra-ra and ambitious. Found myself in a slump a couple of times along the way and questioning why the heck am I doing this to myself. Do I really need to pile on such a heavy academic load? Probably not, with the modules I have taken, I can opt for a pretty easy route with minimal load till Y4S2. And this would leave me more room in other ventures. <br/><strong>Yet, the persistent thought that there’s always more to learn lingers.</strong></p>\n<p>This thirst for more knowledge isn’t too surprising. After all, ML is a huge field encompassing various complex sub-disciplines. There’s the mathematics and algorithms aspect. Then, there’s the whole bulk with OS and parallelism to optimize training time. A good ML engineer would also need to have strong mastery over databases and managing data pipelines. And if we discuss real-time training and scaling resources, it’s difficult not to mention cloud computing. All these are deep, deep rabbit-holes.</p>\n<p>But I acknowledge I should not be biting off more than I can chew. I do feel burnt-out at times and I doubt that’s any good health-wise nor conducive to learning. Knowledge retention is one other issue I am currently grappling with - somehow i’m forgetting quicker than I would like and concepts get mumbled-jumbled up in my head if I leave them alone for too long. An intentional effort to recap needs to be present and I suppose this calls for a break from another ridiculous semester. <br/>\n<span class=\"thoughts\">\n<i>Or not lol.</i>\n</span></p>\n<p>Gonna roll the dice on this. You’ll know what’s up if I go on another hiatus.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d44e612bad1f98c559fa88e9a70da2ea/6a068/dior2.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.1081081081081%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"dior2\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/d44e612bad1f98c559fa88e9a70da2ea/1c72d/dior2.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/d44e612bad1f98c559fa88e9a70da2ea/a80bd/dior2.jpg 148w,\n/static/d44e612bad1f98c559fa88e9a70da2ea/1c91a/dior2.jpg 295w,\n/static/d44e612bad1f98c559fa88e9a70da2ea/1c72d/dior2.jpg 590w,\n/static/d44e612bad1f98c559fa88e9a70da2ea/a8a14/dior2.jpg 885w,\n/static/d44e612bad1f98c559fa88e9a70da2ea/6a068/dior2.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <em>Another picture of Dior because how can you possibly resist?</em>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Monthly Diaries Didn't Last..
