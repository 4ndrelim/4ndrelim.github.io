My name is Andre. I'm a third year undergraduate studying Mathematics & Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n      I like reading about research on AI and advancements in ML, and spend a fair portion of my time doing so. ML is a field where I can put what i've learnt in brutal math courses (𝘢𝘵 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘵 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘪𝘵.. *_*) to use. I believe there's plenty of exciting research done in the ML landscape, and more can certainly deployed in practice.\n      Deep learning, Natural Language Processing, AI decision making - are some sub-fields that excite me. But i've some exposure in the basics of other fields - Databases, Networks, Operating Systems, Parallel & Distributed systems to name a few. I hope to hone my knowledge in my remaining semesters and become a proficient ML engineer able to bridge the gap between software development and ML deployment.\n      Beyond academia, I am an avid climber and belong to the school's Mountaineering club.

This journey has been nothing short of marvelous, food, people, sights, all in equal measure. But these experiences deserve their own detailed recounting another time. Today’s piece is about two memorable trips that left me yearning for more, the catalyst for many adventures in the Nordic regions and beyond.</p>\n<h2>Krabi, Thailand</h2>\n<h3>Impromptu Dive Trip</h3>\n<p>It was around early March when during one of the training sessions, the club’s president asked me if I would like to join in obtaining a diving certification while exploring Krabi’s diving sites. He’s an intriguing man so say the least. Somewhat of a ladies’ man, though opinions vary wildly depending on who you ask. If not for his charms, it would be his lobster risotto that seals the deal. Our mountaineering club tends to attract these sort of adventurous souls. <br/>And i’m not much different - young and dumb, so why not?</p>\n<p>The only hitch I anticipated was the tight schedule; I would be heading to Krabi just 2 days after exams and would be back just 2 days before my month-long trip in Nepal. Interestingly, I wasn’t alone in this mad rush, a fellow teammate set to join the Himalayan trip is just as spontaneously silly.</p>\n<h3>Wonderful Food</h3>\n<div>\n  <em>\"Hey Andre, damn, should I just eat the Green Curry Crab? It's not a vegetarian-dish though..\"</em>\n  <br/>\n  <em>\"Hey Andre..\"</em>\n  <br/>\n  <em>\"Hey Andre..\"</em>\n  <br/>\n  <em>\"Actually, I realised, crabs aren't technically meat. They are kinda like insects of the sea y'know.\"</em>\n  <br/>\n  - Wang Rizhao \n</div>\n<br/>\n<p>Food there was amazingly tasty and fairly affordable. Dishes like fried rice, Tom Yum were a constant presence as every dinner’s table But my god, it was the Thai-fried omelettes that never fail to impress. That perfect blend of crispiness and tenderness was irresistible, and indeed, I ordered one after another. My love for eggs became a well-known fact at every meal.</p>\n<p>I also recalled an interesting encounter with the waiters on one of the nights. We had travelled long and far and finally reached Ruen Mai restaurant. A pack of hungry wolves we were and we quickly ordered a myriad of dishes. It wasn’t long before the table big enough for perhaps 8-9 but sitting the 5 of us were fully filled. We overheard the staff giggling and one even sheepishly questioned if we could finish.</p>\n<p>Imagine the shock on their faces the second time they had to return with the menu :).</p>\n<p>Not many pictures of food, so here’s one at a restaurant. Dinner on most nights was by the sea side.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/976f6a4de918edab9d0ff9a17ee01297/eea4a/dinner_by_the_sea.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"restaurant\"\n        title=\"restaurant\"\n        src=\"/static/976f6a4de918edab9d0ff9a17ee01297/1c72d/dinner_by_the_sea.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/976f6a4de918edab9d0ff9a17ee01297/a80bd/dinner_by_the_sea.jpg 148w,\n/static/976f6a4de918edab9d0ff9a17ee01297/1c91a/dinner_by_the_sea.jpg 295w,\n/static/976f6a4de918edab9d0ff9a17ee01297/1c72d/dinner_by_the_sea.jpg 590w,\n/static/976f6a4de918edab9d0ff9a17ee01297/a8a14/dinner_by_the_sea.jpg 885w,\n/static/976f6a4de918edab9d0ff9a17ee01297/fbd2c/dinner_by_the_sea.jpg 1180w,\n/static/976f6a4de918edab9d0ff9a17ee01297/eea4a/dinner_by_the_sea.jpg 1280w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Wonderful Friends</h3>\n<p>This journey was more than just about the thrills of diving and the delight of Thai cuisine.

He’s 1 year my senior, studying Computer Science as well, but with a world of experience. You can find him <a href=\"therizhao.com\">here</a> (EDIT: It’s no longer up..) where he detailed his very interesting life encounters. </p>\n<p>We’ve had long, drawn-out conversations, particularly the night when Ko Lanta faced an island-wide power outage. He told me all sorts of stories, some he’s shared online, and others you’d think he’d keep to himself, especially not with someone who he’d only just met. I really valued the trust he showed in me, and listened attentively to all he had to share. </p>\n<p>A young Rizhao in highschool showed signs of being a trailblazer, with a knack for innovation. He started his own mama shop and built a gaming shed. Well-loved by fellow students though he often found himself at odds with the school authorities. </p>\n<p>Next came the rebel in the army. Never one to tread the conventional route, it was not surprising he would land himself into trouble in a place where regimentation and discipline takes precedence. Some of his stunts were.. pretty out there. Us law-abiding normies would label him as a madman, though might secretly harbour some feelings of admiration. Despite his unconventional approach, or maybe because of it, he gained newfound respect from his peers.</p>\n<p>Rizhao’s entrepreneurial drive didn’t wane; he picked up coding and launched his own ventures. He’s the brains behind Astar Tutors, and here’s a little-known fact: he recently co-founded Sotravel, a rising star in the social travel industry.</p>\n<p>Amidst the hustle, he revealed he felt lost. Without a clear purpose and periodically found himself tearful at a nearby park bench. So, he turned to writing.</p>\n<p>His early days of university was the grind period. Exchange abroad gave him a whirlpool of emotions. Some events unfolded and he spent his last month abroad, with the equivalent of 50SGD in his pocket (which by the way, he blew half of it on an activity that he ultimately passed on), wandering the heartlands of Europe, with a shattered heart.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Damn.. what a broken man. But what a lad..</em></strong></p>\n<p>Fortunately, things turned for the better after his exchange. He landed himself at a reputable firm, committed further to climbing, found a lovely girl, became a vegetarian (??), travelling around, and most importantly, he seems at peace now.</p>\n<div>\n  <b>Andre</b>: <em>\"Hey, how come you stopped writing about your encounters?\"</em>\n  <br/>\n  <b>Rizhao</b>: <em>\"Oh.. there's no need to. I'm no longer sad.\"</em>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<h3>Somewhere, Beyond the Sea</h3>\n<p>Rizhao’s life stories left me with a heavy heart. Already, the boat rides into the sunset, the breeze on my face, the contemplative discussions, left me brooding over my own direction in life. As I looked out over the horizon on one of the many rides, a song I haven’t played in awhile re-surfaced in my mind. I had a hearty time singing with the boys.</p>\n<p>Bobby Darin’s <em>Beyond The Sea</em> would go on and live rent-free on loop in my head for the next few months. In joyous times, I’d sing along with it; on most days, just a hum. It tide me through tougher times and brought back fond memories of my experiences in Krabi and Nepal. </p>\n<p>Spotify informed I’ve replayed it 439 times since May. Proud fan.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/da560453ad0d6526ab656c74fa142211/eea4a/island.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQCAwX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABagrUkvGeIX//xAAYEAEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgEDIf/aAAgBAQABBQLfFLb0Wt//xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIR/9oACAEDAQE/AaSMP//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEv/aAAgBAgEBPwGaaf/EABQQAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQEABj8CX//EABcQAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAERD/2gAIAQEAAT8h1FcPLtX/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEOAf/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEH/2gAIAQMBAT8QgH//xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFB/9oACAECAQE/EJNUf//EABgQAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAETEh/9oACAEBAAE/EElzDhPrs1ZjOl//2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"island\"\n        title=\"island\"\n        src=\"/static/da560453ad0d6526ab656c74fa142211/1c72d/island.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/da560453ad0d6526ab656c74fa142211/a80bd/island.jpg 148w,\n/static/da560453ad0d6526ab656c74fa142211/1c91a/island.jpg 295w,\n/static/da560453ad0d6526ab656c74fa142211/1c72d/island.jpg 590w,\n/static/da560453ad0d6526ab656c74fa142211/a8a14/island.jpg 885w,\n/static/da560453ad0d6526ab656c74fa142211/fbd2c/island.jpg 1180w,\n/static/da560453ad0d6526ab656c74fa142211/eea4a/island.jpg 1280w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Getting Ready</h3>\n<p>The 5-day trip was extraordinary, but as dusk set in, it was time to return.
