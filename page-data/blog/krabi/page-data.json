My name is Andre. I'm a final year studying Mathematics & Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n      Machine learning is an exciting field at the intersection of mathematical theory (brutal math courses finally paying off.. *_*) and software engineering. There's no shortage of groundbreaking research in the ML landscape, and I aspire to be among those who bring these innovations into real-world applications.\n      I am now particularly interested in the intricacies of parallelism in training/inference optimization and distributed systems. I aspire to design the infrastructure of next-generation ML systems and pipelines.\n      Beyond academia, I am a casual climber (an occasional diver, and avid backpacker) and I am part of the university's Mountaineering club and Climbing club.
