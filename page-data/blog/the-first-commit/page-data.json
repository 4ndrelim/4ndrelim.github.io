My name is Andre. I'm a final year undergraduate studying Mathematics & Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n      Machine learning is an exciting field at the intersection of mathematical theory (brutal math courses finally paying off.. *_*) and software engineering. There's no shortage of groundbreaking research in the ML landscape, and I desire to be among those who bring these innovations into real-world applications.\n      I am now particularly interested in the intricacies of parallelism in training/inference optimization and distributed systems. I aspire to design the infrastructure of next-generation ML systems and pipelines.\n      Beyond academia, I am a casual climber (an occasional diver, and avid backpacker) and I am part of the university's Mountaineering club and Climbing club.

I didn’t have to do much aside from customizing certain sections. Even the selection of the theme is inspired by a senior with a similar site. That said, I do like the simplicity of the design and the features it offers. I think it suits me. After all, front-end really isn’t my forte and I doubt i’d make a good UI/UX designer. Anyway, the default site also comes with a blog. I pondered for awhile whether to have it removed but figured it isn’t such a bad idea to leave it as a dumping ground for my thoughts every now and then. So, here I am :).</p>\n<h2>And So The Hustle Continues</h2>\n<p>I haven’t yet mentioned what even spurred this on. But you might’ve guessed it. August is the time when most firms begin their recruitment process. Every computing kid down the block is scrambling to beef up their resumes, color their portfolios and impress with dynamic sites. <em>Scary</em>.</p>\n<p>Turns out, i’m no exception.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult not to feel the pressure when everyone around you is spending most of their waking hours in preparation while juggling a full term of coursework. I even bailed from an exciting diving and hiking trip at Dragon Horns in Tioman Island (Malaysia) with my fellow mountaineering friends. :/</p>\n<p>I was the only one (save the exchanger) not to go, so yeah FOMO 😔 was strong. Still, I’m glad they are having a blast. It’s unfortunate how much of a rat race this has become but let’s leave that discussion to some other time.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0bc9a4b4436fc5bb3aad9704611f84cf/eea4a/lovely_friends.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"friends\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/0bc9a4b4436fc5bb3aad9704611f84cf/1c72d/lovely_friends.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0bc9a4b4436fc5bb3aad9704611f84cf/a80bd/lovely_friends.jpg 148w,\n/static/0bc9a4b4436fc5bb3aad9704611f84cf/1c91a/lovely_friends.jpg 295w,\n/static/0bc9a4b4436fc5bb3aad9704611f84cf/1c72d/lovely_friends.jpg 590w,\n/static/0bc9a4b4436fc5bb3aad9704611f84cf/a8a14/lovely_friends.jpg 885w,\n/static/0bc9a4b4436fc5bb3aad9704611f84cf/fbd2c/lovely_friends.jpg 1180w,\n/static/0bc9a4b4436fc5bb3aad9704611f84cf/eea4a/lovely_friends.jpg 1280w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Anyway, I was going about my own preparation (mostly LeetCode grind. <strong>Disgusting — yes, I know</strong>) when someone in my Computing cohort announced that he has compiled a list of firms, mostly top and out-of-my-league ones, and has kindly decided to share with everyone else. Naturally, this is a great thing! And it saves me time having to look up some pesky companies’ careers pages that tend to avoid LinkedIn or other job searching sites. But I glanced through the profile of interested applicants, a close friend’s one as well, and thought to myself,</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>damn.. <br/>they've got some real solid portfolios and pretty sites</em>..</p>\n<p>It made me anxious. I thought about making a site from scratch too, but felt my time could be better spent elsewhere, like writing now LOL 🫣. Realistically, I’m not sure I have the commitment to build an entire website from scratch.</p>\n<p>I have some reservations about how consequential having a (very simple) portfolio site would be. But I suppose it does provide some form of self-assurance, if nothing else.</p>\n<p>So there we have it, 5am deep into the night (or morning wtv), just finished wrapping up the site and left a short read for whoever that chances upon this blog. Goodnight -.-</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The First Commit","date":"August 23, 2023","description":"Why a portfolio?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/the-first-commit/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/another-busy-semester/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Embarking on a New Chapter with a Ton of Unearned Confidence"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
