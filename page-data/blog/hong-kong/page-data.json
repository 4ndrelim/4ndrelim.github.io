My name is Andre. I'm a final year studying Mathematics & Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n      Machine learning is an exciting field at the intersection of mathematical theory (brutal math courses finally paying off.. *_*) and software engineering. There's no shortage of groundbreaking research in the ML landscape, and I aspire to be among those who bring these innovations into real-world applications.\n      I am now particularly interested in the intricacies of parallelism in optimizing training code. My goal is to become capable of bridging the gap between software development and ML deployment.\n      Beyond academia, I am a casual climber (an occasional diver, and avid backpacker) and am part of the school's Mountaineering club and Climbing club. Together with a couple of 𝘸𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘶𝘭, 𝘧𝘶𝘯-𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘤𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘰𝘰𝘴, we scaled the Himalayas and it was simply fantastic!","author":"","email":"andre_lin@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/4ndrelim","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-linhk/","research":"https://dblp.org/pid/393/8428.html"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"7df4e363-7e6e-5c38-8b1d-ad8265b04ecf","excerpt":"Okay.. the description was admittedly dramatic.

Not all is shit of course. But Hong Kong does remind me of an alternate Singapore - similar in so many ways but I am often reminded this isn’t home. And as a true blue Singaporean, naturally I would diss a little on my lovable sunny island.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hong Kong: The City That Never Sleeps","date":"August 18, 2024","description":"Bustling city.
