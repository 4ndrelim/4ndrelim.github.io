My name is Andre. I'm a third year undergraduate studying Mathematics & Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n      I like reading about research advancements in Machine Learning. ML is an exciting field at the intersection of mathematical theory (brutal math courses finally paying off.. *_*) and software engineering - where magic comes to life and 𝘉𝘭𝘢𝘥𝘦 𝘙𝘶𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘳 teases at a possible future. There's no shortage of groundbreaking research in the ML landscape, and I aspire to be among those who bring these innovations into real-world applications.\n      ML is a broad and dynamic field with plenty to learn. While i've developed some foundation in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, to name a few, there remains much more to explore. I am now particularly interested in the intricacies of parallelism (and coding) in optimizing training code. My goal is to become a proficient ML engineer, capable of bridging the gap between software development and ML deployment.\n      Beyond academia, I am a casual climber (an occasional diver, and avid backpacker) and belong to the school's Mountaineering club.

They do this by introducing a recurrent connection through a hidden state that allows information to flow from one time-step to the next. TThe hidden state maintains some form of internal memory, where the output of each step is fed back as an input to the next step. You can ituitively see how this captures temporal dependency - information from previous steps can be utilized in the prediction of the current step. \n      <br><br>\n      Below is an illustration of a single RNN unit.\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.21621621621621%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"rnn\" title=\"rnn\" src=\"/static/3a91877968a74444ec023c0f6d224cc7/1c72d/rnn.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/3a91877968a74444ec023c0f6d224cc7/a80bd/rnn.jpg 148w,\n/static/3a91877968a74444ec023c0f6d224cc7/1c91a/rnn.jpg 295w,\n/static/3a91877968a74444ec023c0f6d224cc7/1c72d/rnn.jpg 590w,\n/static/3a91877968a74444ec023c0f6d224cc7/a8a14/rnn.jpg 885w,\n/static/3a91877968a74444ec023c0f6d224cc7/fbd2c/rnn.jpg 1180w,\n/static/3a91877968a74444ec023c0f6d224cc7/eb656/rnn.jpg 1883w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n      You might notice the recursive nature of RNN.

Indeed it isn&apos;t, but they still contribute to training through computation of loss.\n      <br><br>\n      There are some things worth emphasizing:\n      <ol>\n        <li>The number of unrolling of the RNN is a hyperparameter that typically depends on your data and task</li>\n        <br>\n        <li>Illustration suggests input is 1 dimensional. Naturally, you can have multiple dimensions in the input. But the weights become a matrix, similar to how they do in fully connected layer of an ANN</li>\n        <br>\n        <li class=\"note\">RNNs are inherently limited in their ability to capture long-term dependencies (unable to well-utilize inputs from several timesteps before). And you can kind of see why from the unrolling. <br>\n        Imagine unrolling 49 times to predict <i>y50</i>. Earlier inputs like <i>x1</i> still influence the output, albeit through <b>many repeated multiplication</b> with <i>w2</i>. The magnitude will be carried over to gradient computation, resulting in highly unstable training.</li>\n        <br>\n        <li>I&apos;ve drawn the illustration to only include 1 hidden state. In practice, you will likely have multiple more hidden states connected sequentially, and to other hidden states across time steps.</li>\n        <br>\n        <li>Illustration below shows a multi-layer RNN architecture. Note that each hidden state can be influenced by other hidden states in the previous time step (even though the diagram doesn&apos;t seem to suggest it). So, we will have a weight matrix between hidden states. Which means the number of weights grows quadratically with the number of hidden states.</li>\n      </ol>\n      <div style=\"width: 30%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;\">\n          <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 552px; margin: 0 0 30px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 118.24324324324324%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAYCAYAAAD6S912AAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAD8klEQVR42mVVaW8jRRDt/y8+IC0gAR+QkLLiECRhYZcP5MRJfNvj2+Nr7HjGdxzf4yuPepWd4N2MNJrpOl/Vq+42y8Uci9kEy+UCm80Wvr/CYj4V2RTr9VpkGwQ2K7XZqDx4uaZcY4idOUvW8XOoget0HXwKdRdH50W8izroD0fYSIKzZA2/3Di4lO9uy0Cbl2Br0Z8nqvj11sFFqg7zW9TFV5cD/BlvS7g9EnYHX/xVw4/hEdrdAdbLOX5Xmz5Ooy3sNv5BQKlI9CeRFt6cd3Eac2GurQaOzvL4N1VRhHazg6N/MjgJFTEcjRUh0b+9KOIqYQvCzSflEuG1+P50WZIKKjAsoZCzsN9JL1YrDVqrlDEeDfH09CQ9XYtui2I+i83a/9hD//8+ynorqMvFvCY37XYb2VwOzWZTg43HY+RyeZTLthC1xH6/h+d5yOXzaDQaYvGkibbbrb7Uu6IvlctoOA5MtVpFrVZDqVRCr9dDNpuVgDl1DnSZTEYTFgoFdDodtFotzGYzzOdz1cfjcdXTx9A4lUqhWCwqurwgCYVCmsCRjK7rIhqNalDqBoMBut2uBlssFqoPh8MKpFKRHk6nUyQSCTw+Pmopu91OlUTBf5ZEZyYdjUZqQ1lQMtdESx/qDYXsFb++7+uXAfgfDDED04m6w6EO3sMYhgKiDJx18oXtl7EIdos4fL5LDseHIPg1/Emn09qPgDX2j30KSqOORBEl0VJGZ75cMwb1BGbIEptNAbORCCYgCQxKosoyEtRblqXB6Rigo57s04ZxDNklOxyR+/t7JJNJJYn/REp9LBbTkbBtW8miLUlkYOpvbm5Qr9dVZ4I54pcPZzESiWjWyWSiKKhjIiYO2D3sMeWcAh0bCkl5QIbuZ0EyHD5vvYBFlnzI/OdfAqC/bj2W9rytoIG4ZtBgVDi87BGRBrMaEEI920N01BsasicMwG3FxhM+yaER5SyXayYiAP4TDQmhDXcKZXwNmbGEURqzyQxwdxeWdVkz9/t9ZT2bzWlZ3A0PDw8akBVQHxcSecDQ1/Dot1JJOfbnUsJeSyoV5RDw3JfyfHHOWGlJONHZDEoO5nbJOc1mMBHmjdcbIpbOw+sNxHCLyXSGZFZ6WG9iqTvGR6c/QtwqoO315Ox7vVs8OdnpQ705jTj49tLF34mmXgFWtYM3H2y8vfU0yWa1wGm4ju+vPLyPOa+ugPVqiT/uKvhOYrxPtGGOo218fe7hXeT58EzaHr78UMMPV/dwP94px+Emvrno4OSu9vpOkYTHtzWNcRppwvAOIapq05N4ey0vbcspXm1Lz2Zy7K9hOx4yYlNxXOnbp3cK9RXxzdS6avcfH5fwaA9gYIoAAAAASUVORK5CYII=&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"multi-layer RNN architecture\" title=\"multi-layer RNN architecture\" src=\"/static/2ffc53986e50a7c6eaab5e91678821da/08c0b/multirnn.png\" srcset=\"/static/2ffc53986e50a7c6eaab5e91678821da/12f09/multirnn.png 148w,\n/static/2ffc53986e50a7c6eaab5e91678821da/e4a3f/multirnn.png 295w,\n/static/2ffc53986e50a7c6eaab5e91678821da/08c0b/multirnn.png 552w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n          <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>Image credit: d2l.ai</small></p>\n      </div>\n    </span>\n</details>\n<p>Rcurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were among the first architectures to process sequential data.

In practice, multiple LSTM units are chained together across time steps, similar to how multiple hidden states are used in an RNN. \n        <br>\n        Despite these gated mechanisms, <strong>LSTM can still suffer from vanishing (and exploding) gradient problem when dealing with very long sequences</strong>. Gradients can still diminished when passed through many layers of activation functions which constraints the output.\n        <br><br>\n        <strong>Do you see why LSTM is referred to a variant of RNN?</strong> <br>\n        Essentially, if you replace the hidden state in the vanilla RNN with the LSTM unit (and maintain a running long-term memory), you get an LSTM model!\n    </span>\n</details>\n<p><br><br/>\nBut there is merit for aspiring machine learners to study (or grasp the idea) the evolution of architectures starting from RNNs. Understanding their limitations sheds light on the inspiration behind the subsequent development. RNNs sought to retain past information to influence subsequent outputs, making them suited for sequential tasks such as time series prediction. They were simplistic in their design, which made them popular but also inadequate. RNNs suffer significantly from the exploding and vanishing gradient problems, which severely limit their ability to capture long-term dependencies (see RNN section).</p>\n<details>\n    <summary>Exploding Gradient</summary>\n    <span style=\"font-size:13px;\" class='info'>\n      Exploding gradients occur when the gradients used to update the weights grow exponentially as they are propagated back through the network. This can lead to extremely large gradient values, causing numerical instability and resulting in the weights oscillating wildly (and possibly not converge).\n    </span>\n</details>\n<details>\n    <summary>Vanishing Gradient</summary>\n    <span style=\"font-size:13px;\" class='info'>\n      On the other hand, vanishing gradients occur when the gradients shrink exponentially during backpropagation. This leads to very small gradient values, causing the updates to the weights to be insignificant. The result is that the network struggles to learn due to insignificant updates to its weights.\n    </span>\n</details>\n<p><br><br/>\nLSTMs came into the picture and the key innovation in LSTMs that helps manage gradient issues is their gated architecture, better regulating the flow of information through the network. However, in practice, LSTM units are still chained in succession, and will struggle with extremely long sequences. Processing data sequentially (each step must wait for the previous step to complete) inherently limits the parallelization within the training process. And because it is uni-direcitonal (information only flows one way), it is perhaps not suited in capturing nuances in natural language due to its limited ability in gathering context from both past and future simultaneously. </p>\n<p>Thus, the advent of Transformers.</p>\n<h2>The Transformer</h2>\n<details>\n  <summary><b>A Fundamental Appreciation</b></summary>\n    <span style=\"font-size:13px;\">\n      <p>Before going any further, it would be greatly beneficial to have acquired an understanding of the vanilla (dense) neural networks. Appreciate that ultimately, neural networks comprise of <b>just a bunch of weights and biases</b> (a more convoluted linear regression). These are trainable parameters encapsulated in what is commonly referred to as a 'black box' - takes in some input and (hopefully) churn the desired output. <b>The hope becomes tangible if the optimal values of weights of biases are found</b>. And how these values are set, depends on the training process.</p>\n      <p>Of course, there are likely more transformations involved, such as activation functions to introduce non-linearity and batch normalization for stability. You can think of these as fancy accessories that can be swapped among various kinds (e.g. we have the ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh activtiton functions). And I suppose it does make some sense why they are desired, after all, if all we do is to linearly apply weights and biases, the accumulation of all operations ultimately remains linear no matter how many layers of weights and biases. <br/>\n      <b>What hope would we have that this could capture intricate relationships with no clear separation</b>?</p>\n      *-insert vanilla NN with activation fn-*\n      <p><b>Watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\">series</a> by 3Blue1Brown on Deep Learning if you're foreign to all these</b>! Episodes 1-3 offer an enlightening and intuitive perspective of Deep Learning. Episode 4 goes through the calculus behind Gradient Descent, the technique behind the training phase, and might be slightly heavy. If you're math-averse (though frankly, it's the notation that confuses people rather than the underlying concepts), feel free to skip it. The first 3 episodes should sufficiently and satisfyingly equip you with a solid grasp.</p>\n      <p>A short aside on the term 'black box'. Not entirely a big fan of the term though I empathise its common usage. Indeed, the wall of numbers in the layers of a neural network can seem intimidating, and we have no robust intuitive explanation why the input magically transforms into the output. But the key insight is to realise that with a suitable loss function, we can, with Gradient Descent, guide the model to tune its weights and biases based on how similar it is to the desired output. <b>How do we know that Gradient Descent will correctly tune the weights?</b> \n      <br/>\n      Well, this is where Mathematics enter. We can, mathematically show that <b>Gradient Descent always converges to some local minima</b>. Some people may lament that a local minimum isn't the global minimum. <b>But one should question, is the global minimum even desired..?</b> Recall that optimizing the objective function (used in training) does not always translate to the lowest cost in actual production / testing. More often than not, there exists a 'good enough' range of values for the weights to achieve satisfactory performance on the actual cost function. So perhaps, the local minimum found might just fall within this good region, and in some cases, might actually perform better on actual live data than with the weights found from the global minimum.</p>\n      *-insert objective fn vs cost fn-*\n      <p>One last thing, most people confuse the relationship between Backpropagation and Gradient Descent. Gradient Descent leverages Backpropagation to efficiently compute derivatives (gradients) of the loss function with respect to each tunable weights in the network. Sure, you can opt for a different technique to compute gradients, but it likely won't be as efficient as Backpropagation (which only require 2 passes!).</p>\n    </span>\n</details>\n<p><br><br/>\nThe Transformer was introduced in the paper titled <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">“Attention Is All You Need”</a> by a team of researchers from Google Brain. This groundbreaking paper revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing, giving rise to various Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast linguistic capabilities - powerful enough to convince some people that a dystopian era of sentient (lol..) robots is looming.</p>\n<p>Our beloved ChatGPT too, leverages a variant of the original transformer architecture to answer at our beck and call, even silly questions.</p>\n<details>\n  <summary>Anyway, before we continue our exploration of the transformer architecture from bottom-up, i'd like to try to convince (if you aren't already) why it shouldn't be too surprising that an inanimate object can sound so much like a human:</summary>\n  <span style=\"font-size:13px;\">\n    <i>The Gentlemen Bastards</i> is one of my favourite medieval-fantasy series. It incorporated humour well in the midst of chaos and danger. <i>The First Law</i> is also another series I greatly enjoyed. The grim fantasy setting and pragmatic characters were something I found oddly amusing. I chuckled at the heroism that often shattered to pieces, but the book also made me genuinely question whether it would be worth living in such a grim world. The authors have a way with words, they brought the characters to life and got me real hooked. But it's not as if they had actually walked into my study, sat next to me, and read their work aloud with strong passion and intensity to convey every intended nuance. <b>All I did was read a chunk of text</b>.\n  </span>\n</details>\n<p><br></br>\nAnd turns out, the 2017 paper has cracked the code behind human speech. We can train models to chain the right words, with the right punctuation, the appropriate pauses, and whatnot, altogether to emulate human speech.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore how it does it :)</p>\n<h3>Word Embeddings</h3>\n<p>Machines generally only handle numeric input. So, words must first be converted to some numeric form. A vector of numbers is a natural choice. One common method used in the past is to represent words through <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2iVj7WKDFk\">one-hot encoding (OHE)</a>. Already, you can probably sense this isn’t a good choice. For one, the length of the vector has to be the size of your vocabulary, which clearly does not scale well.</p>\n<details>\n  <summary>Why?</summary>\n  <span style=\"font-size:13px;\">\n    Adding 1 more unique word to the vocabulary means adding 1 more dimension to the representation!\n  </span>\n</details>\nOne-hot encoded vectors are extremely sparse (each word exists in its own dimension). And it doesn't quite capture semantic relationship between words that are 'closer' in meaning, for instance, male and female vs animal. \n<p>Thus, the need for word embeddings. Word embeddings are still vectors of numbers, but now, distance between the vectors matter. <b>Think of these vectors as giving coordinates in some high dimensional space (albeit not as high as OHE) where words with similar meanings tend to be closer to each other in that space</b>. This might sound very intuitive and almost trivial, but you might be surprised to learn that it wasn’t until the mid-2010s that word embeddings received widespread adoption.</p>\n<p>The implication is that the model can now learn patterns or relationship among words apply it elsewhere. For instance, if the model learns the vector difference (helpful for visualisation, but god knows whether the model learns more fanciful operations instead) between the representations of <em>Man</em> and <em>Woman</em>, it could apply and learn <em>King</em> as to <em>Queen</em>. <br/>\nAs another example, consider <em>Pasta</em> as to <em>Italy</em>, and if I ask <em>Ramen</em> as to <em>??</em>, you would most likely suggest <em>Japan</em>. This vector space representation is precisely what we desire to meaningfully capture the words.</p>\n<details>\n  <summary>How?</summary>\n  <span style=\"font-size:13px;\">\n    <p>There are popular and powerful techniques such as Word2Vec and GloVe that can capture word embeddings very well. If you're mostly dealing with normal english (and probably other languages) vocabulary, existing pre-trained GloVe and Word2Vec models should already be highly effective. After all, we don't expect the English Dictionary to change too often.</p>\n    <p>If you're interested, Word2Vec employs a shallow neural network (SURPRISE SURPRISE..) architecture to learn word embeddings. GloVe obtained embeddings differently by calculating global co-occurrence matrix. Yes.. fancy terms, feel free to read up.</p>\n  </span>\n</details>\n<h3>Positional Encodings</h3>\n<h3>Tokenization</h3>\n<p>I’ve been casually assuming the model knows how to parse a sentence into individual words, and very naturally such that the individual ‘words’ align with the words in our english language vocabulary. This isn’t always the case. A more appropriate terminology would be ‘tokens’. A token could be a word or little pieces of words that are commonly used. This offers greater flexibility. For instance, the model might find it more helpful to have <em>‘-ing’</em> as a token rather than have to separately capture <em>‘eating’</em> and <em>‘playing’</em> on top of <em>‘eat’</em> and <em>‘play’</em>.</p>\n<p>In practice, we often use some popular tokenizer from a Library (e.g. NLTK) to parse the corpus of text. Embeddings are then computed from these tokens found. The collection of all tokens is your dictionary (aka vocabulary).</p>\n<h3>The Secret Sauce: Pay Attention!</h3>\n<h3>Trusty-old Softmax</h3>\n<h2>Heart of the Transformer: Self-Attention</h2>\n<h2>Different Architectures</h2>\n<h3>Encoder-Decoder</h3>\n<h3>Encoder-Only</h3>\n<h3>Decoder-Only</h3>\n<h2>Heck, they are all the same!</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Nothing Fancy, Pay Attention","date":"December 09, 2023","description":"Attention Mechanism behind LLMs - One of the more enlightening moments from this hectic semester"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/pay-attention/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/vanished/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Monthly Diaries Didn't Last..
