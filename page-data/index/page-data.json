My name is Andre. I'm a final year studying Mathematics & Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n      Machine learning is an exciting field at the intersection of mathematical theory (brutal math courses finally paying off.. *_*) and software engineering. There's no shortage of groundbreaking research in the ML landscape, and I aspire to be among those who bring these innovations into real-world applications.\n      I am now particularly interested in the intricacies of parallelism in training/inference optimization and distributed systems. I aspire to design the infrastructure of next-generation ML systems and pipelines.\n      Beyond academia, I am a casual climber (an occasional diver, and avid backpacker) and I am part of the university's Mountaineering club and Climbing club. Together with a couple of 𝘸𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘶𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘧𝘶𝘯-𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘤𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘰𝘰𝘴, we scaled the Himalayas and it was simply fantastic!","author":"","email":"andre_lin@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/4ndrelim","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-linhk/","research":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8V3uqYAAAAAJ&hl=en","projects":[{"name":"PaperDebugger: 𝘞𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘦 𝘉𝘦𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳, 𝘎𝘦𝘵 𝘈𝘤𝘤𝘦𝘱𝘵𝘦𝘥","description":"Delivered as my Final Year Thesis project.
