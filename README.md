# Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio, and a little bit of my personal experience rummaging through life.

## Credit
Naturally, I did not come up with such a sleek design. It was adapted from an open-source [devFolio](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devfolio) made by [Ryan Fitzgerald](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald).

Devfolio is a modern and production-ready personal portfolio and blog template built on GatsbyJS and styled with TailwindCSS. Easily show off your projects, experience, and skills, as well as write blog posts showcasing your knowledge.

P.S. Stole this idea from a senior too :)
