_No way ain't Norway._

# The North
Norway is the furthest north i've ever been. The month-long back packing trip in Norway was split into two parts: first two weeks with friends from my ACJC days, and the next two, a solo trip making my way from Tromsø back down to Oslo. I'll keep this post short. It's part of a series of trips that grew from the [seeds](../seeds-of-change-2/). But Norway was at least special enough to pause and write about.

## Meeting the Boys
First, i had to link up with the others. They flew a few days earlier to spend some time in Germany while I chose to fly direct to Oslo on Christmas Eve. It turned out to be cheaper, probably because far fewer people were travelling. It was a quiet, pleasant ride.

We went about trying different street food.

Norway has no shortage of fjords, trains, frozen seas, and pretty skylines.

Here's one of us chasing the views.

I like the architectural style in Norway. From afar, everything looks composed and tranquil, lights glowing softly in the snow. Up close, the houses feel more personal, cozier and friendlier.

## What We Did
We mostly wandered around, visited museums, went skiing and sledding, took whale-watching rides and see the fjords, enjoyed bonfires, and chased the lights. Pretty typical tourist things, but no less enjoyable.

## We Feasted
Oh we did not hold back on food. We enjoyed both cheap and fancy options throughout our stay. <br>Below were some of the fancier ones.

_Pricey.. oh but,_ 
**_this is it, man!_**

## Games and Chill
Some days we decided to just chill at our Airbnb. Interestingly, the owner was a man named Miguel originally from Africa. He fits, almost too well, the image of a mysterious man with a past. A well-built figure with scars and tattoos. Seeing him don an apron and vacuum the floor somehow better completed the picture.

Coincidentally, we spotted him dining at at a Chinese restaurant. The owner mentioned Miguel was a regular that comes weekly with a young Chinese kid. _Even more interesting.._

        Yeah, wasn't the best. 30 SGD for what should be 5 SGD fried rice back in Singapore. The rice itself wasn't bad, just wildly  over-priced. But I guess they charged a premium because it is considered exotic in Norway.
        <br><br>
        One tip: you might want to let the staff know you’re Asian, if they can’t already tell. I learned that they actually tune the spice and seasoning levels to better suit European tastebuds.

Anyway, when we aren't out, we'd be relaxing in our lodge cooking and playing board games. Made ourselves a _Charcuterie Board_ too, with Norway's signature cheese, Brunost.

# A Solo Trip Down South
Two weeks went by quickly. It was time to embark on the next phase.

I sailed the Arctic Sea to Svolvær, in Lofoten. A quiet, serene town. Rows of fishing houses, dramatic mountains, and the best mushroom risotto I’ve ever had.

Some mornings, I'd wake up, and sigh to myself:

<p align="center"><b><em>This is it, man.</em></b></p>

I visited an ice bar on my first day at Lofoten. Had a few drinks and chatted with locals. Managed to find my accommodation for the night, recommended by the bartender.<br>
It was a cozy house with a sweet old lady who had been hosting backpackers for years. Her bathroom walls were filled with messages from travellers all over the world. I left a small note too, a mark from Singapore.

Here's Turbo, her cat.

I took the train further south to Bodø, then Trondheim and spent my days wandering aimlessly. I also noticed Norwegians seem to have a fondness for unusual poses and sculptures..

## Brief Reflection
There was plenty of time for solitary reflection. Travelling alone offers a kind of experience I think everyone should try at least once. It creates space for self-exploration, and nudges you to engage more openly with the locals or fellow travellers. You meet like-minded people with stories to tell. Some light, some heavy. You talk and drink, laugh and then bid the goodnight, fully aware you'll likely never meet again. _Slightly melodramatic_.

But i've also realised we are social creatures. The trip was fun, adventurous, and had a kind of unencumbered poetic energy. Perhaps it was the short daylight hours, or Norway's quiet melancholy, but by 4pm, the sky would be dark and the streets empty. More than once, I found myself walking alone down a street lit by a single lamp, and I couldn’t help but wonder:

<br>
