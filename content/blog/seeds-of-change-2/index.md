# Himalayas, Nepal
The 5-day extraordinary Krabi trip left me with a heavy heart. But there wasn't any time to ruminate over parts of life just yet. We have undergone roughly 4 months of grueling training. Now, it's time to scale the Himalayas, time to witness its ethereal beauty. The energy within the team was vibrantly infectious. And why wouldn't it be?

Views were stunning. I'll let the pictures speak.

## The Hike Begins
We begun the track from Syabrubesi, a small village at an altitude of 2,380m above sea level. It serves as the starting point to Langtang Valley. It was a long, narrow, bumpy, **really bumpy** ride from Kathmandu. Occassionally i'll open my eyes, look out to the window, and see how teasingly close we are to the edge of some spiraling road, down to a nausealy tempting valley.

    <summary>Nepalese Car Horns Are Strangely Musical</summary>
    <span style="font-size:13px;" class="info">
      I noticed the car horns had an interesting rhythm to them. Not the typical jarring blasts you hear in Singapore, nor, honestly, in most parts of the world. There's a reason for this. The roads are narrow, under-developed, and often exposed to sheer cliffs, with mirror aids almost non-existent. So what happens when you approach a bend or blind spot? Drivers use their horns to announce their presence. It’s a form of echolocation. And over time, I suppose the manufacturers decided that if everyone was going to be honking half the day, the horns might as well sound a little more melodic.

We celebrated our arrival at Syabrubesi after a long 10-hour bus ride with Bak Kwa, a Singaporean local delight made of sweet, smoky barbecued pork. Our guides and helpers were instantly hooked. We exchanged small gifts: they shared their local treats with us, and we offered them our club shirts in return. It was strangely heartwarming to see how much they appreciated something so simple — and even more so to hear that they still wear those shirts to this day while hosting other trekking groups.

    <summary>Bak Kwa Did Not Come Easy</summary>
    <span style="font-size:13px;" class="info">
      We brought a total of 4 kg of Bak Kwa to share, and man did it prove to be a lifesaver later on at high altitude. Heated Bak Kwa in the damning cold was simply bliss. Our Nepalese friends enjoyed it just as much. And for that, we have Davian — arguably the most resourceful of our bunch — to thank. But he went through great peril to acquire it.
      <br><br>
      The stash was split into 1.5 kg of packaged Bak Kwa and another 2.5 kg of fresh slices from a famous Malaysian chain. Davian is well known for two things: his bike and his willingness to cross the border into JB for side-hustles and food adventures. Right before the trip, he embarked on a covert mission to bring back as much Bak Kwa as humanly possible. The only issue, of course, was that pork imports into Malaysia are technically illegal. But that didn’t deter him from attempting to smuggle 3 kg of fresh meat across the causeway.
      <br><br>
      <b>That fateful day, he got caught.</b>
      <br><br>
      Funnily enough, the immigration officer checked only the front boot, where a measly 500g sat, and completely missed the remaining 2.5 kg hidden at the back. Davian has often insisted he is terrible at maintaining a poker face, and in his panic, he accidentally offered a Muslim officer pork. Fortunately, the officer found his panic hilarious, had a good laugh, and let him go.
      <br><br>
      And that is how close we were to losing our lovely haul of meat — hundreds of dollars’ worth.

    <summary>Porters..?</summary>
    <span style="font-size:13px;" class="info">
      If you’ve noticed, I’ve been deliberately avoiding the term “porters.” I learned from one of the helpers that our Nepalese friends aren’t too fond of it. Perhaps some stigma from the past, the word seems to make them feel reduced or looked down upon. They much prefer the term “helpers,” which feels more respectful and collaborative. So if you ever find yourself hiring guides or support staff for your hikes in Nepal, do take care to address them properly!

Even though the journey had barely begun, Syabrubesi felt like a gentle prologue to the mountains. The air was sharper, fresher and the river carved through the villages with glass-like clarity.
