So, I'm travelling around Norway and currently on board sailing the arctic sea. This journey has been nothing short of marvelous, food, people, sights, all in equal measure. But these experiences deserve their own detailed recounting another time. Today's piece is about two memorable trips that left me yearning for more, the catalyst for many adventures in the Nordic regions and beyond.

## Krabi, Thailand
### Impromptu Dive Trip
It was around early March when during one of the training sessions, the club's president asked me if I would like to join him and get a diving certification while exploring Krabi's diving sites. He's an intriguing character to say the least. Somewhat of a ladies' man, though opinions vary wildly depending on who you ask. If not his charms, it would be his lobster risotto that would seal the deal. Our mountaineering club tends to attract these sort of adventurous souls. <br/>And i'm not much different - young and dumb, so why not?

The only hitch I anticipated was the tight schedule; I would be heading to Krabi just 2 days after exams and would be back just 2 days before my month-long trip in Nepal. Interestingly, I wasn't alone in this mad rush, a fellow teammate set to join the Himalayan trip was just as spontaneously silly.

### Wonderful Food

Food there was amazingly tasty and fairly affordable. Dishes like fried rice, Tom Yum were a constant presence as every dinner's table But my god, it was the Thai-fried omelettes that never fail to impress. That perfect blend of crispiness and tenderness was irresistible, and indeed, I ordered one after another. My love for eggs became a well-known fact at every meal.

I also recalled an interesting encounter with the waiters on one of the nights. We had travelled a long way and finally reached Ruen Mai restaurant. Us hungry wolves quickly ordered a myriad of dishes and it wasn't long before the table big enough for perhaps 8-9 but sitting the 5 of us, were fully filled. We overheard the staff giggling and one even sheepishly questioned if we could finish.

Imagine the shock on their faces the second time they had to return with the menu :)

Not many pictures of food, so here's one at a restaurant. Dinner on most nights was by the sea side.

### Wonderful Friends
This journey was more than just about the thrills of diving and the delight of Thai cuisine. It was a trip where we discovered new facets of each other's personalities, our outlook on life, and motivations to continue mountaineering.

Then there's Rizhao, who went from being an ordinary acquaintance, to a close friend I occasionally seek advice from. He's 1 year my senior, studying Computer Science as well, but with a world of experience. You can find him [here](therizhao.com) (EDIT: It's no longer up..) where he detailed his very interesting life encounters. 

We've had long, drawn-out conversations, particularly the night when Ko Lanta faced an island-wide power outage. He told me all sorts of stories, some he's shared online, and others you'd think he'd keep to himself, especially not with someone whom he'd only just met. I really valued the trust he showed in me, and listened attentively to all he had to share. 

### A Look Into The Life Of A Fascinating Youth

Young Rizhao in highschool showed signs of being a trailblazer, with a knack for innovation. He started his own mama shop, built a gaming shed in a deserted corner, and even tried to launch a company. Well-loved by fellow students though he often found himself at odds with the school authorities. 

Next came the rebel in the army. Never one to tread the conventional route, it was not surprising he would land himself into trouble in a place where regimentation and discipline takes precedence. Some of his stunts were.. pretty out there. Most of us law-abiding normies would label him as a madman, though might secretly harbour some feelings of admiration. Despite his unconventional approach, or maybe because of it, he gained newfound respect from his peers.

Rizhao's entrepreneurial drive didn't wane; he picked up coding and launched his own ventures. He was the brains behind Astar Tutors, and here's a little-known fact: he recently co-founded Sotravel, a rising star in the social travel industry.

Amidst the hustle, he revealed he felt lost. Without a clear purpose and periodically found himself tearful at a nearby park bench. So, he turned to writing.

His early days of university was his grind period. Exchange abroad gave him a whirlpool of emotions. Some events unfolded and he spent his last month travelling. Having only the equivalent of 50SGD in his pocket (which by the way, he blew half of it on an activity that he ultimately passed on), he wandered the heartlands of Europe, with a shattered heart.

**_Damn.. what a broken man. But what a lad.._**

Fortunately, things turned for the better after his exchange. He landed himself at a reputable firm, committed further to climbing, eventually found a lovely girl, became a vegetarian (??), travels around, and most importantly, he seems at peace now.

### Somewhere, Beyond the Sea

Rizhao's life stories left me with a heavy heart. Already, the boat rides into the sunset, the breeze brushing face, the contemplative discussions, left me brooding over my own direction in life. As I looked out over the horizon on one of the many rides, a song I haven't played in awhile re-surfaced in my mind. I had a hearty time singing with the boys.

Bobby Darin's _Beyond The Sea_ would go on and live rent-free on loop in my head for the next few months. In joyous times, I'd sing along with it; on most days, just a hum. It tide me through tougher times and brought back fond memories of my experiences in Krabi and Nepal. 

Spotify informed I've replayed it 439 times since May. Proud fan.

### Getting Ready
The 5-day trip was extraordinary, but as dusk set in, it was time to return. I came, slightly apprehensive, worried squeezing in this trip might be a mistake. Yet, I left with much to ponder. Though back then, I haven't had the time to fully reflect on these experiences and so I carried them to Nepal instead.
